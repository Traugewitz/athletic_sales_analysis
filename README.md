# athletic_sales_analysis
Module 5
This exercise is taking athletic shoe sales data and having us combine two different years and combine them into one DataFrame
We then sort the data by region, by retailer, by day of the most sales, and lastly by week with the most women's athletic footwear
sales.

We use groupby and pivot.table sort functions.
